# BitcoinTaxesAPI

Connect with the BitcoinTaxes API using python :

This post is designated ONLY to keep your time not spent unwisely.

Warning : 
The API the website provides only allow two functions :
1. Retreive transactions
2. write new transactions

None of the suffisticated functions - "calculate capital gains", "choose methods" are even an option,
Niether those for general information - "Coins value per date per exchange" - NO.

And even then, personally, I couldn't load from the server more then 1 single transaction per request.
But otherwise, its a great website and can be extremely usefully with manual use.

enjoy.
